## Introduction
My name is Jacob Ashcraft. I was named after one of my ancestors 
that always ate his dessert first before dinner, and 
complained he didn't get any dessert after, and so he ate a second helping.

I was first introduced to computers when my parents bought one. It was a Windows 98, and I remember
it using DOS. My siblings and I played lots of games. Some of which included typing games.

As I continued exploring the games, my friends and I got into Blizzard Entertainment games.
