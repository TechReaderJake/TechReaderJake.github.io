<!-- Salutation -->
Dear Reader,

Having a lifelong love for technology, I was thrilled to be able to gain the skills for the passion I love.
As I continue to move forward in the Software Industry, I hope to increase and expand upon these skills
that I have learned. In particular the ones for Web Development and Digital Media Design.

I really enjoy developing websites and learning the front and backend of development. I truly have a passion
for designing front end pages and implementing the design.
