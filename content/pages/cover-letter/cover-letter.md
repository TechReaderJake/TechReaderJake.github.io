<!-- Salutation -->
Dear Reader,

<!-- Opening Paragraph -->
<!-- Get them hooked and make them read on -->
Having a lifelong love for technology, I was thrilled to be able to gain the skills to repair, build, maintain computers. This was expanded to read, understand, and write programming logic for them, in the particular languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. As I continue to move forward in the Software Industry, I hope to increase and expand upon these skills that I have learned. In particular the ones for Web Development and Digital Media Design.

<!-- Second Paragraph -->
<!-- Why you are theperfect fit for the company -->
I really enjoy developing websites and learning the front and backend of development. I truly have a passion
for designing front end pages and implementing the design. I am most familiar with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
I have some experience with C#, React, PHP, MySql, MongoDB. I have also learned the basics of programming through the langauges of C++, and Java.

<!-- Third Paragraph -->
<!-- Why the company is the perfect fit for you -->
I was introduced to my first version control system in 2018, and have come to love the usage of Git. I have learned about agile methodology, continuous integration, automation, tests, and other task tracking systems such as Azure DevOps, and Jira.

<!-- Closing Paragraph -->
My desire to learn and develop software motivates me to get things done. I love working with people and helping
others and receiving help. I enjoy working together to build something wonderful that will be valuable for other
people to use in their lives.

<!-- Formal Closing -->
My Kind Regards to you reader for your time,

Jacob Ashcraft

<!-- Postscript -->
<!-- Seal the deal -->
P.S. I would value any opportunity to progess my skills in the Web Industry while providing for my family.
